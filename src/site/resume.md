### Projects
#### Rising Campaigns Platform: Rapid-Response Static Sites
#####  <a href="https://risingcampaigns.com/" rel="noreferrer prefetch" target="_blank">Custom rapid-response websites </a>from content to production in 48 hours.

I conceived and architected a platform for creating custom, rapid-response websites in hours. The platform relies on continuous integration, the JAMStack, and headless CMS. The websites rely on a component-based architecture that allows over 1 million combinations and custom typography, colors, and branding. Platform sites benefit from version control, continuous integration, system monitoring, documentation, and a support ticketing system.  </p>

#### Revere Splash: Rapid-response Static Sites
##### Customizable rapid-response landing pages from content to production in fifteen minutes. 

Conceived and architected a platform for creating rapid-response landing pages in minutes. Revere Splash relies on continuous integration, the JAMStack, and headless CMS. Users create splash pages through an Angular2 app, customize the appearance with an inline editor built with Vue, and each landing page deploys from Github to Netlify as a static site. </p>

#### Custom Wordpress Workflow and Boilerplate Theme
##### Tools and workflows that transitioned siloed staff into an integrated, high-functioning team

With each <a href="https://youtu.be/aZiukBJ_a7U?t=12" target="_blank">success</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/273623-candidates-debate-fallback-go-to-my-website" rel="prefetch" target="_blank">traffic spike</a> As Lead Front-End Developer I broke down silos and moved the team to collaborate on design and development in real-time throughout production. I added structure and tools to our Wordpress workflow, standardized design deliverables, Q/A processes and <a href="https://mbeu.jeffrummel.com/" rel="prefetch" target="_blank">coding standards</a>. Technologies include Wordpress, SCSS, gulp, Vagrant, Docker/Lando.</p>
